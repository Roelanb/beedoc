# Auto-Paragraph Creation and Drag-and-Drop Test

## What Was Implemented

The editor now automatically creates paragraphs when you type text, and these paragraphs are automatically made draggable.

## How It Works

### 1. Auto-Paragraph Creation

The `ensureParagraphStructure()` method runs on every input event and:
- Wraps any loose text nodes in `<p>` tags
- Ensures the editor always has proper block-level structure
- Wraps inline elements in paragraphs if needed
- Creates an empty paragraph if the editor is empty

### 2. Automatic Drag-Handle Addition

The DragDropManager's MutationObserver automatically:
- Detects when new paragraphs are added to the editor
- Calls `makeDraggable()` on the new paragraph
- Adds a drag handle (⋮⋮) to the paragraph
- Attaches all necessary drag-and-drop event listeners

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Typing Creates Paragraphs

1. Open BeeDoc at http://localhost:8080
2. Clear all content (Ctrl+N or delete everything)
3. Start typing: "This is my first paragraph"
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Text appears in a `<p>` tag (check browser DevTools)
   - A drag handle (⋮⋮) appears on the left
   - The paragraph can be dragged

### Test 2: Multiple Paragraphs

1. Type some text
2. Press Enter to create a new line
3. Type more text
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Each Enter creates a new paragraph
   - Each paragraph gets its own drag handle
   - All paragraphs can be dragged independently

### Test 3: Drag Newly Created Paragraphs

1. Type 3 different paragraphs
2. Click the drag handle on the second paragraph
3. Drag it above the first paragraph
4. **Expected Result**:
   - The second paragraph moves above the first
   - The blue drop indicator shows where it will be placed
   - After dropping, the order is preserved

### Test 4: Mixed Content

1. Create a paragraph by typing
2. Use Alt+1 to create a heading
3. Type more text (creates another paragraph)
4. Add a list using the UL button
5. **Expected Result**:
   - All elements (paragraphs, headings, lists) are draggable
   - Each has a drag handle
   - Can be reordered in any way

### Test 5: Empty Editor Initialization

1. Clear the editor completely
2. Click in the editor
3. Start typing
4. **Expected Result**:
   - An empty paragraph is created automatically
   - Cursor is placed in the paragraph
   - Text appears in the paragraph
   - Drag handle appears immediately

## Technical Details

### Code Flow

```
User types text
    ↓
handleInput() triggered
    ↓
ensureParagraphStructure() called
    ↓
- Checks for loose text nodes
- Wraps them in <p> tags
- Adds new <p> to DOM
    ↓
MutationObserver detects new node
    ↓
DragDropManager.makeDraggable() called
    ↓
- Creates drag handle
- Adds to paragraph
- Attaches event listeners
    ↓
Paragraph is now draggable!
```

### Cursor Preservation

The `ensureParagraphStructure()` method:
1. Saves cursor position before making changes
2. Wraps text in paragraphs
3. Restores cursor to the same position
4. Allows uninterrupted typing

### Performance Considerations

- `ensureParagraphStructure()` is optimized to only make changes when needed
- Uses `Array.from()` to avoid live NodeList issues
- Cursor restoration uses try/catch to handle edge cases
- MutationObserver only watches direct children (not subtree)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Still Work

All existing keyboard shortcuts continue to work with auto-paragraphs:
- **Ctrl+B** - Bold text in current paragraph
- **Ctrl+I** - Italic
- **Alt+1-6** - Convert paragraph to heading
- **Enter** - Create new paragraph
- **Ctrl+N** - New document (starts with empty paragraph)

## Browser DevTools Check

Open DevTools (F12) and inspect the editor element:

```html
<div id="editor" class="editor" contenteditable="true">
  <p class="draggable-section" draggable="true">
    <div class="drag-handle" contenteditable="false">⋮⋮</div>
    This is a paragraph
  </p>
  <p class="draggable-section" draggable="true">
    <div class="drag-handle" contenteditable="false">⋮⋮</div>
    Another paragraph
  </p>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Paragraphs Not Being Created

Check browser console for errors:
```javascript
console.log(window.editor);
```

Try manually calling:
```javascript
window.editor.ensureParagraphStructure();
```

### Drag Handles Not Appearing

Check MutationObserver is working:
```javascript
console.log(window.dragDropManager);
```

Check for new paragraphs:
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.draggable-section').length;
```

### Cursor Jumping

If cursor position is lost, it's usually during the paragraph wrapping. The code includes cursor restoration, but complex selections might not restore perfectly.

## Success Criteria

✅ Typing creates paragraphs automatically
✅ New paragraphs immediately get drag handles
✅ New paragraphs are draggable without refresh
✅ Cursor stays in correct position while typing
✅ No console errors
✅ Existing functionality (formatting, shortcuts) still works
✅ Can drag newly created paragraphs to reorder them

## Known Behaviors

1. **Pressing Enter** creates a new paragraph (standard contenteditable behavior)
2. **Empty editor** starts with an empty paragraph ready for typing
3. **Paste operation** may create multiple paragraphs depending on content
4. **Drag handles** are added to new paragraphs within milliseconds (via MutationObserver)
5. **Existing content** gets paragraphs wrapped on first edit

This implementation ensures a seamless experience where users can:
- Type naturally without thinking about structure
- Immediately drag any paragraph they create
- Reorder content fluidly without page refresh
